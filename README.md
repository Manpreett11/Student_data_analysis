# Student Data Analysis

This project analyzes student data from an Excel file (`Python Data.xlsx`) using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook ([23102B2002_internship.ipynb](Student_data_analysis/23102B2002_internship.ipynb)).

## Project Structure

- `23102B2002_internship.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all analysis code and visualizations.
- `Python Data.xlsx`: Source data file with student information.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.  
   Install required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**  
   Open `23102B2002_internship.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code and run the cells.

## Analysis Overview

The notebook covers the following analyses:

1. **Unique Students**: Counts the number of unique students.
2. **Average CGPA**: Calculates the average CGPA.
3. **Graduation Year Distribution**: Visualizes student distribution across graduation years.
4. **Python Experience**: Shows the distribution of students' experience with Python.
5. **Average Family Income**: Computes average family income (mapped to numeric values).
6. **CGPA by College**: Visualizes top 5 colleges by average CGPA.
7. **Outlier Detection**: Detects outliers in attendee status and course quantity.
8. **CGPA by City**: Plots average CGPA for each city.
9. **Family Income vs CGPA**: Examines relationship between family income and CGPA.
10. **Expected Salary Factors**: Visualizes how CGPA, family income, and Python experience affect expected salary.
11. **Popular Events by Field**: Identifies which events attract students from specific fields.
12. **Leadership Analysis**: Compares CGPA and expected salary for students with/without leadership skills.
13. **Leadership Correlation**: Calculates correlation between leadership skills and expected salary.
14. **Graduating Students**: Counts students graduating by end of 2024.
15. **Promotion Channel Effectiveness**: Shows which channels bring more student participation.
16. **Data Science Event Attendance**: Counts students attending Data Science events.
17. **High CGPA & Experience Salary Expectation**: Analyzes salary expectations for students with high CGPA and Python experience.
18. **Event Awareness by College**: Finds students who learned about the event from their college and lists top 5 colleges.

## How to Use

- Update the path to `Python Data.xlsx` in the notebook if needed.
- Run each cell to see the analysis and visualizations.
- Modify or extend the notebook for additional insights.
